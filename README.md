# Fourier waft library

## Todo:
- Scale intensities in RGB images based on the difference between the original and wafted image
- Map different parts of the spectrum to different colors, e.g. within the annulus to red, outside to green. Also interesting would be to map frequencies via a colormap, though low frequencies would dominate colors the resulting image.
